You can write whatever you want to in the Acknowledgements, I have seen thanks to videogames, rubber ducks, takeaway restaurants, Karl Marx and so on. Some people even go as far as to put down things or people that got in the way of their thesis. If you consider going that route, keep things civil! Still, this is your space, there's no real guidelines, include a fancy quote then several paragraphs about ghosts if you like, or maybe a poem that speaks to you. Have a think about it. 



After this comes the mandatory table of contents. 

\textbf{Lists of Tables and Figures, Glossary, List of Publications by the Candidate}

It is \textit{optional} to provide these lists. If provided, then they should start on the page following the table of contents and be in the order: Tables, Figures, Glossary (list of abbreviations), Publications.  

Items in lists of Tables and Figures should be in the order in which they occur in the text.
