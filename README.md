HW_LaTex_thesis_template
========================

Thesis LaTex template based on the submission guidelines of Heriot-Watt University, that I have personally updated. 
Aside: these guidelines are mainly for PhD theses but are also valid for non PhD research dissertations/theses (specifically for those writing up an MRes or MPhil).

The template has been updated to support subfiles (for rendering each chapter independently of the full document) - a feature helpful for theses with lots of images, especially large ones. Other small tweaks are applied such as support for using acronyms in the document with the acro package, replacing the more cumbersome glossaries package. 

Additionally the university shield is now updated to something I cropped and cleaned myself, rather than the previously included one which looked like it was traced lovingly in microsoft word.
 
Lastly, links to the university guidance are included, and text in each section describe the relevant portion of the guidance. 

November 2021: I have updated the documentation to be clearer about cleveref, and have added biblatex which allows per-chapter bibliographies. To-do notes have also been added. More mathematics support was added in out of the box too.
